/*
PROGRAM NAME: MATHS QUIZ
PROGRAM DESCRIPTION: The following program is a menu based maths quiz.
option 1: generates the users request for the amount of questions to be generated
option 2: displays the game based on the users amount
option 3: displays the amount of correct and incorrect questions
option 4: prompts user to quit the game.
If the user enters a number outside the range on 1-4 an error will display
if the user enters a letter the program will return an error prompt to the user.
The program will count up the amount of correct and incorrect questions generated by the users request and reset when option 3 is pressed.
